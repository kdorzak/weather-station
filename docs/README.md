# Project Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains documentation related to the project. Its purpose is to gather materials that explain the concepts, operation, and usage of the system in an organized and easily accessible manner.

## Directory Contents

This directory includes various types of documents such as guides, conceptual descriptions, user instructions, and supporting materials. The documentation is general and conceptual in nature, focusing on explaining the ideas and functions of the project without delving into implementation details.

## Structure and Navigation

The documentation is divided into thematic sections to facilitate finding the needed information. For example, it may include materials covering an overview of the system, descriptions of individual components, or configuration and usage instructions. Each section contains documents with related topics, allowing intuitive navigation through the resources.

This directory serves as a starting point for individuals seeking to understand the project, both new users and development teams. The documentation is prepared to be used by humans as well as tools that assist in analysis and information processing.
