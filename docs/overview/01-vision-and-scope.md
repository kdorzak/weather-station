# Vision and Scope

## Vision

The vision of this project is to develop a reliable and maintainable weather station system that serves as a serious hobby endeavor. The system aims to provide accurate and consistent weather data over the long term, supporting ongoing operation and incremental improvement.

## Intended Audience

This document is intended for contributors to the project as well as individuals to whom the project is explained. It provides a clear understanding of the goals, boundaries, and guiding principles that shape the development and operation of the weather station system.

## Scope

The project focuses on creating a weather station system that delivers dependable weather data collection and storage. It emphasizes correctness and durability over time, balancing cost considerations with the need for accuracy. The system is designed to be operated and maintained by hobbyists with a commitment to long-term use.

## Out of Scope (For Now)

Certain enterprise-grade concerns are currently out of scope for this project. These include real-time alerting capabilities, compliance with regulatory standards, and other advanced operational features typical of commercial weather systems. The project prioritizes foundational functionality and reliability before expanding into these areas.

## Guiding Principles

- **Reliability:** The system should operate consistently and provide accurate data over extended periods.
- **Cost-Consciousness:** While low cost is a priority, investments that materially improve correctness and reliability are justified.
- **Simplicity:** The design and operation should remain straightforward to facilitate maintenance and contribution.
- **Longevity:** The project is intended as a long-running system, with a focus on sustainability and ongoing improvement.
- **Clarity:** Documentation and communication should be clear and accessible to both contributors and interested audiences.
