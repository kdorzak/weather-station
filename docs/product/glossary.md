## Telemetry
Automated communication processes by which measurements and other data are collected remotely and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.

## Threshold
A predefined limit or value that triggers an alert or action when crossed.

## Time Series Data
Data points indexed in time order, typically representing measurements collected over intervals.

## Trigger
A condition or event that initiates a specific process or action within the system.

## User
